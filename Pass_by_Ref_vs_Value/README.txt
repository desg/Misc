This is a program that compares the speed of passing an object by reference and by value. This was created for my own personal interest.

Obj holds an array of integers of arbitrary size, and in main.cpp, an Obj is passed by value to one function a certain number of times, and by reference to another function a certain number of times.  The time it takes to do each operation is printed at the end of execution.

To compile, place main.cpp and Obj.cpp in a directory and type: g++ main.cpp

To run, type ./a.out
